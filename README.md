With this project, I aim to build a functional microblogging platform. The 
purpose for this is to gain experience with the meteor platform, and build a
production-ready app from start to finish.

## Current Features

* news feed, containing all posts from all users
* Reddit-style comment trees
* ability to like posts and comments
* simple user accounts and profiles, the ability to view a particular user's
    posts
* following/friendship system to restrict newsfeed items to those from friend
    circle

## Planned Features

* information-rich user accounts
* the ability to search for users based on multiple criteria
* private IM system
